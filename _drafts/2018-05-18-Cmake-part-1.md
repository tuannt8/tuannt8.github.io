# Why **CMake**

I have been using `XCode` in Mac and `Visual Studio` in Windows. They are pretty good, but going back and forth to maintain the code get anoying. `Makefile` is the fundamental solution for cross platform, but it can be messy. `CMake` was introduced to resolve that. So, it is a simple multi-platform solution.

The other reason to choose `CMake` is because of the wonderful ide [CLion][clion-link], offered by *Jet Brains*. This `C++` ide is a morden software that gives us many features from refactoring to debuging.

# How's my notes going
As I going to guidline of CMake, I get lost. It is a bit complicated. So I noted this guide, which will be very **practical**, i.e. just what you need, no bullshit.
