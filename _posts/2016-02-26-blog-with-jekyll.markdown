Coming to the decision of making a personal webpage, I have been looking for various option. Basically, I want a static page to introduce myself and a simple blog. The more important is that I can control my page.

There are services that provide us instant blog like `Blogger` and `Word press`, etc. However, we can only use the available themes as it is difficult to edit. `Google app` lets us upload the web to their server, but it lacks the support for writing code and costs to have our own domain.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
