`Jekyll` is a good choice for blogging with markdown text.
{% include image-caption.html  img="/img/main-page-thumb.jpg" width="350" caption="My site with Jekyll"%}

Coming to the decision of making a personal webpage, I have been looking for various option. Basically, I want a static page to introduce myself and a simple blog. The more important is that I can control my page.

There are services that provide us instant blog like `Blogger` and `Word press`, etc. However, we can only use the available themes as it is difficult to edit. `Google app` lets us upload the web to their server, but it lacks the support for writing code, and it costs to have our own domain.

`Jekyll` is blog platform for geeks. You can program what you want.

* [Start from here to have `Hello World!` web](https://jekyllrb.com)
* [Jekyll Cheatsheet](http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/jekyll.html)

Take some time to adjust your page following your ideas, and then comeback to the original template {% include emoj.html name="smile" %}.

By the way, my blog lands at:
{% include icon-github.html username="tuannt8/tuannt8.github.io" %}. I bought my custom domain [tuannt8.info](http://www.tuannt8.info) from [godaddy](https://godaddy.com), which costs `10$` per year.
