We write the document in the `markdown` form. For one who don't know, 

# Why `markdown`:

Our options:

* Word then export: MS word, page:
* ibook author
* Sigil
* html
* markdown

Markdown is the best. Can also make it available in your website with ease.

For markdown, we can use `pandoc` to generate the epub. We may need some `css` file to customize our epub.

# Step by step
