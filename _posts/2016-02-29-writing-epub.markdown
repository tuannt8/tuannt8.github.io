We write the document in the `markdown` form. For one who don't know, `markdown` is the easy way to write formatted text.

Update: Use `Sigil` is better. We dont need to study about `epub` element, and it have good font and layout. also for it can directly modify epub file.  

Write in markdown, convert to html and import to `Sigil`.

# Why `markdown`:

Our options:

* Word then export: MS word, page:
* ibook author
* Sigil
* html
* markdown

Markdown is the best. Can also make it available in your website with ease.

For markdown, we can use `pandoc` to generate the epub. We may need some `css` file to customize our epub.

# Step by step
