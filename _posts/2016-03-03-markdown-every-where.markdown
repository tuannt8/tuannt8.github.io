Using markdown for every thing to have a nice looking format.

{% include image-caption.html img="/img/why-markdown.png" caption="Markdown text and its preview" width="600"%}

So I intended to use `atom` to render markdown for every thing, but it has limitations in some cases.

* For `email` and general formated text: [`http://dillinger.io`](http://dillinger.io) is good.
* For `epub`: difficult to style the epub to make it good on both mobile and tablet. [`Sigil`](https://sigil-ebook.com) is good.
* For `blogging` with [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com): Atom is good

In summary, markdown is useful.
